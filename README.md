# astemes-excel-report-teststand-plugin
Simple csv report plugin for NI TestStand.
The purpose of this plugin is to generate a simple csv file containing test results when running an NI TestStand sequence.
The feature set is currently limited to handle most common step types, but can easily be extended.
This plugin is meant as a tool for quickly and easily sharing results during development and integration of a tester, as the format is more portable and easier to read than the default markup language based reports.
